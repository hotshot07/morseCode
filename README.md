# Morse Code Translator

A simple Arduino project to communicate in Morse code with a single LED     
Just type your text into the input in main loop and it translates it into morse code       
Currently only works for letters F U K C Y and O              
Perfect for if you have an annoying roommate and if you want to be passive agressive about something he/she did :)
